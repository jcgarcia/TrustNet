# TrustNet

**Decentralized Trust Network** - Web3 Identity & Reputation

Blockchain-based trust network with modular architecture, hot-swappable features, and production-ready VM infrastructure.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### One-Liner Installation

Install a TrustNet node with a single command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcgarcia/TrustNet/main/install.sh | bash
```

This will:
- ✅ Download and setup Alpine Linux VM
- ✅ Configure Caddy web server with SSL
- ✅ Deploy TrustNet core infrastructure
- ✅ Setup blockchain node (Cosmos SDK + Tendermint)
- ✅ Generate startup scripts in ~/vms/trustnet/

Installation takes approximately **10-15 minutes** depending on system speed and network.

### Prerequisites

The installer needs QEMU:

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y qemu-system-x86_64 qemu-utils
```

**RHEL/Rocky/AlmaLinux:**
```bash
sudo dnf install -y qemu-system-x86_64 qemu-img
```

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S qemu-system-x86
```

## 📁 Project Structure

TrustNet uses a **modular architecture** that separates core infrastructure from features:

```
TrustNet/
├── core/              # VM infrastructure (rarely changes)
│   ├── tools/        # Installation scripts
│   └── docs/         # Core documentation
│
├── modules/           # Feature modules (hot-swappable)
│   ├── web-ui/       # Main web dashboard
│   ├── identity/     # Identity registration
│   ├── transactions/ # Transaction viewer
│   ├── keys/         # Key management
│   └── blockchain/   # Node integration
│
├── api/              # Backend REST API
│   └── src/          # API services
│
└── docs/             # Documentation
```

### Why Modular?

- **Fast Development**: Edit code on host → auto-sync to VM → see changes instantly
- **No VM Rebuilds**: Add/remove features without touching core infrastructure
- **Safe**: Core VM protected in separate git branch
- **Scalable**: Each module is independent with its own frontend/API

See [MODULAR_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md](docs/MODULAR_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md) for architecture details.

## What is TrustNet?

TrustNet is a distributed consensus network built on Tendermint, providing:

- **Decentralized consensus** - BFT consensus engine via Tendermint/CometBFT
- **Container registry** - Distributed image repository for containerized applications
- **IPv6 ULA networking** - Secure inter-node communication via unique local addresses
- **Automated deployment** - Single-command installation on any Linux system with QEMU
- **Production-ready** - Alpine Linux base, optimized for minimal resource usage

## 📋 What's Included

### trustnet-node VM
| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Purpose** | Tendermint consensus validator |
| **Disk** | 50GB QCOW2 (vda) |
| **RAM** | 8GB |
| **CPUs** | 4 cores |
| **Network** | IPv6 ULA fd10:1234::1 |
| **RPC Port** | 26657 (blockchain queries) |
| **P2P Port** | 26656 (validator communication) |
| **User** | warden (node operations) |

### trustnet-registry VM
| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Purpose** | Container image registry |
| **Disk** | 30GB QCOW2 (vda) |
| **RAM** | 4GB |
| **CPUs** | 2 cores |
| **Network** | IPv6 ULA fd10:1234::2 |
| **HTTPS Port** | 8053 (registry API, Let's Encrypt certificate) |
| **Health Check** | /health endpoint (HTTPS) |
| **User** | keeper (registry operations) |

### Common Features
- **OS**: Alpine Linux 3.22.2 ARM64 (5MB base image)
- **Networking**: IPv6 ULA (Unique Local Address) - no external dependency
- **Virtualization**: QEMU/KVM with QCOW2 disk images
- **SSH Access**: Ports 2222 (node), 2223 (registry)
- **Caching**: ISO images and binaries cached in ~/.vms/cache/ for fast reinstalls

## 🔌 Network Architecture

### IPv6 ULA (Primary Access - Recommended)
Direct VM access without port forwarding needed:

```
Network: fd10:1234::/32 (IPv6 Unique Local Address)
├── fd10:1234::1 (trustnet-node)
│   ├── SSH:   port 22 (direct IPv6 access)
│   ├── RPC:   port 26657 (HTTPS, Tendermint queries)
│   └── P2P:   port 26656 (encrypted validator communication)
└── fd10:1234::2 (trustnet-registry)
    ├── SSH:   port 22 (direct IPv6 access)
    └── HTTPS: port 8053 (Let's Encrypt certificate, auto-renewed)
```

### Localhost Access (Testing Fallback)
Port forwarding via QEMU for IPv4-only systems:

```
localhost:3222 ──→ fd10:1234::1:22 (node SSH)
localhost:3223 ──→ fd10:1234::2:22 (registry SSH)
localhost:8053 ──→ fd10:1234::2:8053 (registry HTTPS)
```

**Note**: Registry port 8053 uses HTTPS with Let's Encrypt certificates. For HTTPS connections via localhost, certificates are valid when accessing as `registry.trustnet.local` (configured in /etc/hosts by installer).

## 🛠️ Using TrustNet

### Start the VMs

After installation completes:

```bash
# Start both VMs
~/vms/trustnet-node/start-trustnet-node.sh
~/vms/trustnet-registry/start-trustnet-registry.sh

# Wait ~30 seconds for services to start
sleep 30
```

### Access Methods

**Preferred: Direct IPv6 ULA Access** (no port forwarding, standard ports)
```bash
# SSH into node VM (via IPv6)
ssh -6 warden@fd10:1234::1

# SSH into registry VM (via IPv6)
ssh -6 keeper@fd10:1234::2

# Query Tendermint RPC via HTTPS (IPv6)
curl -k https://[fd10:1234::1]:26657/status | jq .result.sync_info

# Check Registry HTTPS (IPv6)
curl -k https://[fd10:1234::2]:8053/health | jq .
```

**Fallback: Localhost Testing** (for IPv4-only systems, with port forwarding)
```bash
# SSH into node VM (localhost)
ssh -p 3222 warden@127.0.0.1

# SSH into registry VM (localhost)
ssh -p 3223 keeper@127.0.0.1

# Access Registry HTTPS via localhost
curl -k https://localhost:8053/health | jq .
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Verify via IPv6 (recommended)
echo "✓ Testing IPv6 ULA connectivity..."
ssh -6 warden@fd10:1234::1 'echo "Node online"'
ssh -6 keeper@fd10:1234::2 'echo "Registry online"'

# Check Tendermint node status
curl -k https://[fd10:1234::1]:26657/status | jq .result.sync_info

# Check registry health
curl -k https://[fd10:1234::2]:8053/health | jq .
```

### Common Operations

**Push image to registry (IPv6 HTTPS):**
```bash
# Configure for HTTPS registry
docker tag myapp:latest [fd10:1234::2]:8053/myapp:latest
docker push [fd10:1234::2]:8053/myapp:latest

# Or via localhost (testing)
docker tag myapp:latest registry.trustnet.local:8053/myapp:latest
docker push registry.trustnet.local:8053/myapp:latest
```

**Query blockchain (HTTPS):**
```bash
# Get current block height
curl -k https://[fd10:1234::1]:26657/status | jq .result.sync_info.latest_block_height

# Get validator info
curl -k https://[fd10:1234::1]:26657/validators | jq .
```

**Check logs:**
```bash
# Node logs (via IPv6)
ssh -6 warden@fd10:1234::1 'tail -f /opt/trustnet/node/logs/tendermint.log'

# Registry logs (via IPv6)
ssh -6 keeper@fd10:1234::2 'tail -f /var/lib/trustnet-registry/logs/registry.log'
```
