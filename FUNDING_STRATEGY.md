- Community/Crowdfunding: £150K (6%)

- Dragonfly Capital (US: $250M+ AUM)
- Paradigm (US: $700M+ AUM)
- 1confirmation (US: Seed/Series A specialist)

- Index Ventures (Europe + Web3)
- Balderton Capital (London-based)
- General Catalyst (US + Europe)

### Investment Thesis for VCs

**Why VCs should invest in TrustNet:**

1. **Large TAM (Total Addressable Market)**
   - Social networks: $230B market (Meta, TikTok, Snapchat)
   - Fintech/payments: $500B market (Stripe, PayPal, Square)
   - Trust infrastructure: Emerging £50B+ market
   - **Total addressable: £100B+ if 1% penetration**

2. **First-mover advantage**
   - No existing "trust as infrastructure" blockchain
   - Trust is foundational (every platform needs it)
   - Network effects compound with scale

3. **Multiple exit opportunities**
   - Acquisition by major social networks (Meta, X, LinkedIn)
   - Acquisition by major fintech (Stripe, PayPal)
   - IPO as standalone Web3 protocol
   - Merger with DeFi ecosystem leaders

4. **Token economics align with VC returns**
   - VCs get equity in Foundation (traditional stake)
   - VCs receive token allocation (upside in token appreciation)
   - 1-2 year lockup → 4-6 year vesting (pro-rata rights)

### VC Pitch Deck Structure

- Contingency (5%): £60K

We'll hit product milestones in 8-14 months:
- MVP on testnet with 1,000 beta users
- Mainnet launch with 10,000 users
- Target Series A at £50M+ valuation

Your potential return: 30-50x if we reach 1-10M users (conservative)
Market comparables: DeSo (£260M), Mastodon, Bluesky"
```

### For Token Investors (£10K - £100K check)

```
"TrustCoin (TCS) is the native asset of the TrustNet blockchain.

You're buying tokens at £0.01 (Seed Round).
- Distribution price: £0.02-0.05 (2-5x return by mainnet)
- Comparable coins: SOL (started £0.0018, now £180), ATOM (£0.10, now £15)

Token use cases:
- Governance: Vote on protocol changes
- Staking: Earn rewards (10-20% APY)
- Fees: Pay transaction fees (0.1%)
- Rewards: Earn for participation

Your 50M tokens purchased:
- Initial cost: £500K (at £0.01)
- Mainnet value (conservative): £1-2.5M (at £0.02-0.05)
- Year 2 potential: £5-50M (depending on adoption)

Vesting: 2 years (12-month cliff) = Lower risk
Lockup: 6 months from mainnet launch

You're not just buying tokens—you're investing in
a network that becomes more valuable as more people use it."
```

### For Grant Committees

```
"TrustNet addresses the Digital Europe priority of 'decentralized digital services.'

Key impact metrics:
- Financial inclusion: Enable 2B+ unbanked people to participate in economy
- Digital sovereignty: Users control their identity and data (GDPR aligned)
- Trust infrastructure: Open-source, non-discriminatory reputation system
- Green: Proof-of-Stake (minimal energy), not Proof-of-Work

Development roadmap:
- Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Smart contract design, testnet deployment
- Phase 2 (Months 4-8): MVP apps, beta user testing
- Phase 3 (Months 9-14): Mainnet launch, 10K+ users

We request £150K for Phase 1 (Innovate UK):
- 2 smart contract engineers: £60K
- Security audit: £30K
- Legal/compliance: £20K
- Infrastructure: £15K
- Reporting/administration: £25K

This funding will deliver:
- Whitepapers on trust mechanics and governance
- Open-source smart contracts (audited)
- Testnet with 1,000 beta users
- Academic partnerships (universities)

Funding will enable 3 additional engineers and 6-month project acceleration,
helping EU leadership in Web3 infrastructure development."

## Risk Mitigation & Backup Plans

### If VC Funding Slows

**Trigger**: Only £300K committed by April 1 (instead of £1.2M)

**Action:**
1. Pivot to token pre-sale (aim for £1.5M instead of £800K)
2. Accelerate grant applications + EU Horizon Phase 1
3. Bring on strategic advisors as advisors (equity instead of advisory roles)
4. Delay Series A timeline, extend runway to 36 months
5. Reduce team size: 8 people (instead of 12) in Phase 0-1

**Impact**: 2-3 month delay, smaller initial team

### If Token Pre-Sale Underperforms

**Trigger**: Less than £400K raised in pre-sale by March 15

**Action:**
1. Extend pre-sale to April (add 4-6 weeks)
2. Increase allocation in private round (raise £500K instead of £300K)
3. Boost marketing in crypto community (Twitter/Discord campaigns)
4. Bring on more strategic partners with token incentives

**Impact**: No material impact if VC round closes on time

### If Grants Don't Materialize

**Trigger**: Fewer than 2 grants approved by April

**Action:**
1. Reallocate £200K from VC round to R&D + legal/compliance costs
2. Apply to more foundations (MacArthur, Ford, Omidyar in Q2)
3. Focus on EU Horizon Phase 1 (£50K application), delay Phase 2
4. Claim UK R&D tax credits (recover £50-75K)

**Impact**: Reduces cash on hand, but recovers partially through tax credits

### If No VC Lead Investor

**Trigger**: No term sheet by April 1

**Action:**
1. Pursue extended timeline: raise VC over 6 months (not 3)
2. Start with smaller VC rounds (£200K each from 5-6 micro-VCs)
3. Build product first (MVP), then raise on product traction
4. Increase token pre-sale target to £1.5-2M (offset VC gap)
5. Pursue crowdfunding more aggressively (Republic, AngelList)

**Impact**: Slower fundraising, but eventually achievable

- Pre-sale: 50M TCS @ £0.01 = £500K
- Private: 50M TCS @ £0.015 = £750K
- Tokens: 100M total

Employees/Options: 10% (equity)
- Option pool: 100M TrustCoin (4-year vest, 1-year cliff)
- Pre-allocated to first 5 hires

Reserves/Treasury: 45% (equity)
- Used for: Grants, partnerships, future fundraising, incentives

- 2-year horizon to Series A
```
