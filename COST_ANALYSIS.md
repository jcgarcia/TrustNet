## Comparison to Industry Benchmarks

```
Industry Cost Benchmarks (Web3 Projects):

Simple DeFi Token:
  - Cost: £158K-396K
  - Timeline: 6-8 months
  - Team: 5-8 people

Blockchain Layer-1:
  - Cost: £3.95M-7.9M
  - Timeline: 18-24 months
  - Team: 30-50 people

Social Network (Web2):
  - Cost: £790K-3.95M
  - Timeline: 12-18 months
  - Team: 15-30 people

TrustNet (Full Stack):
  - Cost: £1.55M-2.75M (our estimate)
  - Timeline: 14-18 months
  - Team: 12-20 people
  - Complexity: Very High (combines all three)

TrustNet is more complex than simple tokens,
less expensive than full Layer-1 chains,
and combines elements of all categories.
