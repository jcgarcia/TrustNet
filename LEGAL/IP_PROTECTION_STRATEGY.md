# IP Protection & Registration Strategy for TrustNet

**Date**: January 27, 2026  
**Jurisdiction**: United Kingdom + International  
**Status**: Strategic guidance for IP protection

---

## Executive Summary

TrustNet's intellectual property includes multiple types of protections:
- **Trade Secrets** (immediate, no registration needed)
- **Patents** (technical innovations, 3-5 year process)
- **Trademarks** (brand name, logo, 3-4 month process)
- **Copyright** (code, documentation, automatic)
- **Design Rights** (UI/UX, automatic + registration optional)

**Recommended Priority**: Trademarks → Trade Secrets → Patents → Copyrights

---

## 1. IMMEDIATE PROTECTION (No Cost, Effective Immediately)

### 1.1 Trade Secrets Protection

**What it is:**
- Confidential information that derives value from not being publicly known
- Protected by UK Trade Secrets Regulations (2018) + common law
- No registration required
- Lasts indefinitely as long as it remains secret

**What qualifies as Trade Secret:**
- Smart contract code (before public launch)
- Token economics & distribution model
- Business strategy & financial projections
- Technical architecture
- Team & advisor details
- Fundraising approach & investor list
- Community partnerships

**How to protect:**
1. **Mark sensitive documents** "CONFIDENTIAL" or "TRADE SECRET"
2. **Limit access** - only share with employees/advisors under NDA
3. **Secure storage** - encrypted files, password-protected
4. **Audit trail** - track who has access, when documents were shared
5. **Use NDAs** - require all recipients to sign confidentiality agreements
6. **Exit interviews** - ensure departing employees understand confidentiality obligations
7. **Source code control** - use private GitHub repos with limited access

**UK Legal Framework:**
- Trade Secrets Directive (2016) - requires "reasonable steps" to maintain secrecy
- Common law breach of confidence
- Equitable jurisdiction for injunctions
- Right to recover damages + cost of enforcement

**Cost**: £0 (immediate)

**Timeline**: Effective immediately

---

### 1.2 Copyright Registration (Automatic)

**What it is:**
- Automatic copyright on all original creative works
- Includes: Code, documentation, designs, marketing materials
- No registration required in UK

**What qualifies:**
- Smart contract source code
- API documentation
- Whitepaper & technical specification
- Logo & brand assets

- Video/audio content
- Blog posts & content

**How to protect:**
1. **Add copyright notices** to all works:
   ```
   © 2026 [Your Company Name]. All rights reserved.
   ```
2. **License code** under open source license (MIT, Apache 2.0) or proprietary
3. **Document creation date** - proves authorship if disputed
4. **Register with UKIPO** (optional, strengthens enforcement)

**Registration Details:**
- **UK IPO Copyright Registration**: £50 per work
- **Timeline**: 2-4 weeks
- **Benefit**: Public record of authorship, easier enforcement
- **Optional but recommended** for valuable assets

**Cost**: £0 (automatic) → £50/work (registration, optional)

**Timeline**: Immediate (automatic) → 2-4 weeks (if registering)

   - Sent by your solicitor
   - Demands stop use, return materials
   - Often resolves without litigation

2. **Negotiation & Settlement** (£500-2,000, 2-4 weeks)
   - Licensing agreement
   - Damages payment
   - Non-use agreement

3. **Litigation** (£5,000-50,000+, 6-24 months)
   - High Court action for injunction
   - Discovery of evidence
   - Court judgment
   - Cost awards to winner

**Prevention is better than enforcement:**
- Strong NDAs prevent leaks
- Patent marking deters infringers
- Trademark registration prevents brand theft
- Regular audits catch infringement early

## 10. SAMPLE IP STRATEGY DOCUMENT

**For sharing with potential investors/partners:**

```
TRUSTNET IP PROTECTION SUMMARY

Intellectual Property Status:
✓ Trade secrets: Protected via NDA + confidentiality protocols
✓ Domains: trustnet.com, trustnet.uk, trustnet.io registered
✓ Copyright: All original works © 2026, confidential materials marked
✓ Trademark: UK application filed (pending) - "TrustNet"
✓ Design: UI/UX design rights applied for

Protection Roadmap:
Month 3: UK Trademark registration (expected)
Month 6: EU Trademark registration
Month 6: Design Rights registration
Month 12: International Trademark (WIPO)
Month 12: Patent evaluation (if applicable)

Confidentiality Enforcement:
- All team members sign confidentiality agreements
- All investors/partners sign NDAs
- Encrypted file storage with access logs
- Annual IP audit and compliance review
- Regular trademark monitoring for infringement

IP Valuation:
- Trade secrets/algorithms: Core value, indefinite protection
- Trademark: £50,000-500,000 valuation (brand)
- Patents (if granted): £100,000-5M+ value (per patent)
- Overall IP portfolio: Est. £500K-2M value at Series A

This IP strategy positions TrustNet to:
1. Protect core innovations from competitors
2. Build valuable brand identity
3. Enable future licensing/partnership revenue
4. Strengthen valuation for fundraising
```

---

## 11. CRITICAL REMINDERS

### Do's:
✅ Mark documents CONFIDENTIAL
✅ Use NDAs before sharing
✅ Register trademarks early (low cost, high value)
✅ Keep secure backup of all IP documents
✅ Document dates of invention (whitepapers, prototypes)
✅ Register copyrights (optional but recommended)
✅ Monitor competitors for infringement
✅ Update IP strategy as company grows

### Don'ts:
❌ Discuss IP publicly before protection
❌ Share source code without NDA
❌ Assume copyright alone protects code
❌ Delay trademark registration (brands can be stolen)
❌ File patents without professional advice
❌ Ignore IP in employment/contractor agreements
❌ Store sensitive IP on unencrypted/cloud services
❌ Let NDAs expire or lapse

### Investment Impact:
- Strong IP position increases company valuation 10-50%
- VCs expect documented IP strategy
- Trademarks + trade secrets are often more valuable than patents
- IP litigation can sink startups (prevent via strong NDAs)
